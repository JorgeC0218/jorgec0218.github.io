  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>Well there are a lot of ways I can start, but I think I will begin with the basics. I was born in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, I'm 19 years old and when i was a year and a half I was taken to the Unites States, where I was raised most of my childhood. I like
    to practice playing guitar, I love video games and from time to time or usually in my daily commute I will be either beat-boxing or freestyling a bit. I came to Mexico almost five years ago and it's been a roller coaster getting used to the change.
    Now that I am learning programming I feel confident of a more secure future. A few of my strenghts would be that I adapt quickly. Whenever there is a obstacle in my way I try my best to resolve the problem. </p>

  <p>Within the first week of HolaCode I have learned several things. All of which I am really excited to begin using in my life regularly.</p>
