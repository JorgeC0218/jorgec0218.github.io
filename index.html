    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Well there are a lot of ways I can start, but I think I will begin with the basics. I was born in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, I'm 19 years old and when i was a year and a half I was taken to the Unites States, where I was raised most of my childhood. I like
      to practice playing guitar, I love video games and from time to time or usually in my daily commute I will be either beat-boxing or freestyling a bit. I came to Mexico almost five years ago and it's been a roller coaster getting used to the change.
      Now that I am learning programming I feel confident of a more secure future. A few of my strenghts would be that I adapt quickly. Whenever there is a obstacle in my way I try my best to resolve the problem. I also have a open mind which let's me
      understand others point of view and opinions. Now I spend my time working hard on coding and learning as much as I can so I can get where I want to be. I don't consider myself a ambitious person but I have been told that I am because I don't let
      things slow me down when I am pursuing my goals. I consider myself a calm person and usually tend to avoid conflict or violence, but I am not afraid to get my hands dirty either.
